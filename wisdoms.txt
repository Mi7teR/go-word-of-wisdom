The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.
It is better to remain silent at the risk of being thought a fool, than to talk and remove all doubt of it.
Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to reform (or pause and reflect).
When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable.
Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.
The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
